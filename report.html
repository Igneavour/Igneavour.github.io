Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement. 


    The objective of the website is to connect people with interest for the Japanese culture together. Here in my country, there is a lack of a central base of information with regards to this niched interest. Therefore, we would like to provide an avenue where people with a passion for Japanese culture to find out information about relevant events as well as a group or club where these people can come together to enjoy the activities. The structure of my website is a standard top-down hierarchical website where the webpages are distinctly defined at the top of every page connected by a navigation bar where links bring the user to the different webpages if they clicked on the boxes. I chose this structure as it is one of the most common structure and hence, this means that most people would be very familiar with how the site is designed and will therefore have little to no difficulty navigating through the website. 


State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc. 


    Ever since around middle school, I have always been a huge fan of Japanese culture, especially their food and entertainment area. My hobbies are generally video games, figure-collecting and watching Japanese shows or streamers. I have also recently picked up a bit of drawing recently due to the ongoing pandemic, anime-style art in particular. Hence, some of the contents that I presented on some webpages are sketched by myself. The website is a way to visually represent my keen interest in the Japanese culture by showing some of the things that I have done. With the huge amount of Japanese media/products I have consumed such as video games from Japanese game development companies like Capcom and Konami, to anime artists and Japanese streamers, I would be in a better position to create a website catered to people with similar interests than if I tried to create a website in which the topics discussed are not of interest to me. 


State 3 ways in which your site is accessible. 


    The website is designed with contrasting colours for the background and text so as to enhance visibility of the items presented on the pages. This contrast is achieved by providing a background image that is slightly darkened whereas the colour of the fonts are deliberately bright. I have also refrained from using colours to deliver certain contents to cater to the needs of colour-blind users and instead, used only a handful of colours to keep the webpages simple and pleasant to look at. Colours chosen are bright enough to be legible and also, dark enough to prevent putting excessive strain on the eyes. Finally, I have adapted the code of the website so that it is able to accomodate different devices and screen sizes. Especially in these times, mobile phones have been the more common mode of surfing the internet due to it's portability. The styling included screen widths of minimum 1011px for laptops or bigger, screen width between 571px to 1010px for tablet sizes and lastly, a maximum screen width of 570px for mobile phones. Images and other media that are presented on the website are also given alt descriptions so that search engines or in the event the images doesn't render, there is a written description of the image so there is minimally, a context for people who are unable to access the media.


State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site. 


    Since the objective of the website is to hold a platform where people can gather information pertaining to a certain topic or interest, the index is designed such that it has a few summaries as well as redirecters to bring people to the appropriate pages. I have also implemented a navigation bar with concise section names so that users can easily expect what would be shown on that particular page. Additionally, for pages that are slightly longer in height, I have implemented sub-navigation bars that are sticky as well as a back-to-top button to reduce the hassle of scrolling or swiping up to move to another webpage. By also making a slideshow gallery, it helps to compile images that are of the same category to make the website look more organised.


State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site). 


    As I wanted to show images on my website, I thought that having an image carousell would be a neat way to present them. I then went to do some research on w3schools where they provided various functionalities that I can use on my website. Although I found the image carousell, the icons used by default were a little hard to see and so I then had to google for the HTML code for symbols. It was also at that time that I realised that I do not have to look for images for every single icons or symbols and can instead, use HTML codes. During the time spent researching on ways to optimize my website for different screen sizes, I came across videos on Youtube that gave useful tips and advice on things like units to use or to use percentage width as well as various properties that I can use to center or align my objects and items. I also found an advice to use FireFox for web development and tried it and I am now sticking to FireFox due to its extensive support and tools available on their browser developer tools. Any errors that were raised by the console was also accompanied with a suggestion which helped me greatly as a student and as a developer. I was also able to separate the developer tools from the browser which was very handy in letting me reorganise my programs.


What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? 


    I am rather proud of the concept of the website that it had turned out to be. It was as what I had initially envisioned it to be, and I think it portrays very clearly my passion for this particular area of interest. Most of the images used in the website was taken or made by myself, such as the trips to Japan or the sketches done. One look at the homepage and it is clear what the website is related to. 


What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time? 


    I felt that the workflow of my development process can be improved after learning so many things from the research I have done in the midst of creating this website. Instead of just creating a website meant for mainly laptop first, I could have focused on 1 page at a time, taking time to optimize the site for other screen sizes first before moving on to another page. This would have minimised the amount of edits that I had to make on my styling. I would also use percentages for width or item sizes in general and perhaps a different unit of measurement for my font-sizes aside from pixels such as rem which are more flexible units.


What resources were used when creating your work? 
You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.
